    "\n",
    "* **How does 1 decision tree in default random forest takes sub sample or does it train on complete data ? **   \n",
    "*Answer*- If `bootstraping` = False then it takes all samples without replacement. So it will have all the raws. If `bootstraping` = True then it will take len(df) rows but with replacement. So there will be duplicates which make each tree different. Default is *True*  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Because Kaggle is validating on `log error`, does that necessarily mean that log of our independent variable is dependent on dependent variables ?**   \n",
    "*Answer*- The way Random Forests are built is invariant to monotonic transformations of the independent variables  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why not put `oob_score` while using `set_rf_sample` ?**  \n",
    "*Answer*- Because we are passing full data to random forest model and trees are built on subset of data defined in `set_rf_sample`. So each tree will try to calculcate score on remaining data (len(df) - set_rf_sample) which will consume more time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **What did he talk about data leakage problem ?**    \n",
    "*Answer*- Sometimes, we make model on some variables which might not be available during real time predictions. This causes data leakage.  \n",
